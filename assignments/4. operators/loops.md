1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// while(amount < bank_balance){

            amount = PHONE_PRICE + amount;
            
            if(amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD){

                amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
            }
        }
        function calculateTax(){

        var totalAmount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);
        return totalAmount;
        }
        

         if(calculateTax.totalAmount < bank_balance)
         {
             alert(" you can afford it");
         }
         else{
             alert("you cannot afford it");
         }

         function formatAmount(){

            calculateTax.totalAmount = calculateTax.totalAmount;
            
            return calculateTax.totalAmount;
         }
        //  alert (formatAmount());

```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
//  for(var i=0;i<=20;i++)
    {
        if(i % 2 == 0){
            alert(`${i} is even`);
        }
    }
```

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

// for(i=0;i<=10;i++) 
{
 console.log(`${i} *9 = ${i*9}`);
}


4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)
//for(i=1;i<=100;++i)
{
  for(n=1;n<=10;n++)
  {
    document.write(`${i} *${n} = ${i * n}`);
  }
}

5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

//for(i=1;i<=10;i++){
  console.log(i);
}
```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// let i=1;
        let sum = 0;
        while(i<=20){
            
            sum = sum + i;
            i++;
        }
        alert(sum);
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// let i=1;
        while(i<=20){
            if(i % 2 == 0){
                alert(`${i} is even`);
            }
            i++;
        }
```
